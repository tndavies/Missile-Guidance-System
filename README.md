# Missile-Guidance-System

Proportional Navigation (PN) is the primary algorithm used in air target missiles to correct the missile trajectory, ensuring a direct collision with a moving target. This project implements a simulation of a radar system and a homing missile system. The radar's field-of-view is shown by the black frustum, and is coloured red when a target is within range. The below video is a demo of the system homing in on an accelerating target, with the missile's dynamical properties shown by the coloured lines (line-of-sight: blue, velocity: green, acceleration: orange).
