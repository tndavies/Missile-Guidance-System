# Missile-Guidance-System

Proportional Navigation (PN) is the primary algorithm used in air target missiles to correct their trajectory, ensuring a direct collision with a moving target. This project involves implementing a simulation of a radar system and a homing missile system. The radar's field-of-view is depicted by a black frustum, which turns red when a target is within range. The accompanying video demonstrates the system homing in on an accelerating target. The missile's dynamical properties are illustrated by colored lines: the line-of-sight in blue, velocity in green, and acceleration in orange.
